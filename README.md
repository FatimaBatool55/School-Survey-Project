**Highlights:**
- 📚 Students who take frequent assessments tend to perform better.

### 🔍 Project Insights
- **Transport & Performance**: Active transport modes (walking, biking) are linked to better academic outcomes and higher library engagement.
- **Extracurriculars Matter**: Students involved in clubs, sports, or volunteering consistently outperform those with no activities.
- **Stress & Assessment**: Balanced stress and regular assessments contribute to improved academic scores.
- **Institutional Shift**: Many students move from private to public institutions due to dissatisfaction or lack of extracurriculars.
- **Post-Graduation Trends**: Students’ future plans are shaped by their academic experience and institution type.
